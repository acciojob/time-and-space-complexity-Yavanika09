	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Time complexity</b> is a measure used in computer science to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm by describing how the runtime grows relative to the size of the input, denoted as \( n \).
	   It is expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., \( O(1) \), \( O(n) \), \( O(\log n) \), etc.), which categorizes algorithms based on their growth rates.
	   For instance, \( O(1) \) indicates constant time regardless of input size, \( O(n) \) represents linear growth proportional to \( n \), and \( O(n^2) \) reflects quadratic growth for nested loops.
	   Understanding time complexity helps in comparing algorithms and choosing the most efficient one for a given problem.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input, denoted as \( n \).
	   It considers both the fixed part of the memory (e.g., variables, constants, and program instructions) and the variable part (e.g., dynamic allocations, recursion stack, and data structures).
	   Space complexity is expressed using Big-O notation, such as \( O(1) \) for constant space usage or \( O(n) \) for linear space usage.
	   Analyzing space complexity helps optimize algorithms by balancing memory usage and performance, especially for resource-constrained environments.</p>
